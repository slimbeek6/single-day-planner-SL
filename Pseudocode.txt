Need to  create the overall architecture of the page in HTML.
To include:
- Header that automatically displays today's date.
- Container that fits the device or screen.
- Split the container into  9 rows with two columns each, split 10/2 or 11/1 in size
- Include image of save icon in the right columns.
- Color of each box changes depending on time of day, relative to current time. Grey if past, green if present/future.
- Boxes need to allow data entry, and show any data previously saved


Need to create a function that saves information entered into a timeslot.
To do this:
1. Define a new function that we can call on when someone does a "submit" on one of the timeslots.

2. In this function, take the information in the input area, and save it to local storage.
    - This will require saving the item in local storage with timeslot tied to it based on which "submit" was pressed.

3. Ensure that the timeslot is showing any information in local storage tied to that timeslot.

4. If the timeslot has information, change the color to red, otherwise leave as green or grey.


Need to create a double if statement to adjust the color of the background of each timeslot.
To do this:
1. Make sure that all the rows include an identifier that allows java to run on any that are tied to the correct information.

2. When rendering the page, make sure that we set a timestamp, then a for loop to test each hour and see if it is before or after the current timestamp.

3. Set those before the timestamp to grey, those after to green if empty, red if full.
